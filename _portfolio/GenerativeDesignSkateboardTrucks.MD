# Design  

The design for this skateboard truck was based off of the dimensions of a real skateboard truck. Generative design was used to optimize the design to be printed from Nylon 12 and ALSi10Mg on a SLS printer. Due to limited resources and time constraints, the actual 3D printed model was printed using PLA on a fused filament printer. The 3D print proves generative design could be used to create futuristic skateboard trucks using an SLS printer. Many different designs were made during the generative design process. The 3D printed model is an example of one of the generated designs that could be used on an SLS printer to create a lightweight skateboard with the same mechanical properties as a traditional metal skateboard truck. The axel, kingpin, and pivot cup locations are in the exact same locations as a real skateboard truck. This skateboard truck was designed based off of a street skateboard truck. The design could be easily modified and recreated for other types of skateboards such as longboards or beach cruisers.

# SLS and Generative Design Overview

This design uses both powder bed fusion and generative design to create a skateboard truck that is lighter than usual but has the same mechanical properties as a typical skateboard truck. SLS printing has established itself as the go to 3D printing technology for applications requiring high mechanical properties in fields like aerospace and the automotive industry. SLS printing can create parts that have very high dimensional accuracy allowing for more creative designs. High dimensional accuracy also means parts can be printed for applications that require high tolerances for part dimensions such as car engines. There are more and more types of powder that are being optimized for SLS printing. This is great fr innovation because this means car parts, plane parts, and even rocket parts can now be 3D printed instead of cast or milled from a metal such as aluminum and steel. The best 3D printable material is PEKK because it has mechanical properties very similar to metals like steel, but it is much lighter and more complex shapes can be created using this material in a SLS printer. Generative design can be used in the design process to create parts that are much lighter than metal and use as little material as possible but still have the desired mechanical properties. This is a great combination for the automotive industry. There are cars on the road that are already using 3D printed parts such as the Koenigsegg One. It uses a 3D printed turbo that eliminates turbo lag through the use of two separate chambers, each for a specific RPM range. This turbo was made using mSLS but SLS printing with plastics could be used for similar automotive tasks. Air intakes are a great example of a part that could be optimized using generative design and 3D printed for real world applications using a SLS printer. Both technologies are still relatively new to the automotive industry, and it will take some time before both are fully adapted. That being said, once both generative design and SLS printing becomes the norm for car designing, car companies will have the ability to revolutionize the car industry as much as the introduction of gas-powered engines did in 1876. The automotive industry will be forever changed thanks to generative design and SLS printing.
