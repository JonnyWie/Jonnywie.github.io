# Purpose
  This project was to show the capabilities of modern 3D printers to be able to print in place designs. This means the 3D printer can print parts that rotate, hinge, or slide with other parts on a design without any manual assembly required. This has allowed companies to create revolutionary parts that would otherwise be impossible to create. Furthermore, the use of a multi-material 3D printer can take this process to the next level. A design can now be printed in place without any manual assembly needed and multiple types of filaments can be used. 

  This project is an example of how a design can be leveraged to use print in place techniques along with a multi-material 3D printer. The pliers were able to be printed on a regular 3D printer in multiple pieces due to the simplicity of the CAD design. A more complex design would have been very difficult to print in multiple pieces, with varying types of filaments, and still achieve accurate clearance. This same design is capable of being printed at one time with all components already assembled using print in place techniques. If done correctly, the pliers would still open and close like normal, and the TPU spring would adhere to the PLA pliers while remaining fully operational. This is just one example of how print in place 3D printing can build designs that would otherwise be impossible. 




# The Design 
  The purpose of this design was to function like a regular pair of needle nose pliers. The design was kept simple to show the capabilities of printing in place 3D printing and multi-material 3D printers. The two plier handles are printed using PLA. These were relatively easy to model in CAD as they resemble what real pliers look like. The spring component on this design is made of TPU. This allows the material to bend without breaking while also remaining strong enough to return the jaw of the pliers to the open position when not in use. The spring component was the trickiest part of this project because it is very difficult to create a working model in CAD that can open and close due to the limitations of the CAD software. To overcome this problem, I confirmed the spring would fit each handle individually using CAD, and then 3D printed multiple sizes of the spring to determine which would fit best. Once I had found the best size for the spring in this design, I could 3D print the whole design using print in place techniques on a multi-material 3D printer. 


# Specs 
  The goal of these pliers was not only to create a design that could leverage print in place techniques, but also to make the pliers function like a real pair of needle nose pliers. This meant the design of the pliers had to replicate that of real pliers. Small attributes such as ridges to act as grip were even added to the design. Overall the pliers turned out to be fully functional and were very similar to a real pair of pliers. The only adjustment that should be made if this project was repeated would be to decrease the spacing of the plier handles because they are naturally very wide when not in use. This makes the pliers feel less ergonomic and harder to use. Below are the full specs of the pliers. 

* Overall Max height: 170 mm
* Overall Max Width: 120 mm
* Overall Thickness: 10 mm
* Natural Position: Open 
* Plier Handles Material: PLA
* Plier Spring Material: TPU 95A
* Jaw Length: 43 mm 
* Jaw Max Width: 40 mm
* Jaw Minimum Width: 1 mm
* Spring Thickness: 7 mm
* Spring Width: 3.1 mm


# Print Settings 
  The print setting I used were very typical for printing with PLA filament and TPU filament. The PLA was printed at 200C with the bed at 50C. The TPU spring was printed at 240C with a bed temperature of 50C. Only one of the plier handles needed a small amount of support material on a small section where the spring is inserted. Both pliers had an infill of 20%. The spring had an infill of 100% to give it more rigidity. 
The print settings for printing the pliers on a multi-material 3D printer are different than the typical PLA and TPU print settings. An ooze tower was necessary to allow a smooth transition between the PLA and TPU filaments throughout each layer. The Plier Handles were Selected to be printed with PLA and the Spring was selected to be printed with TPU. Limited Support Material was needed for this print. An infill of 20% was used to keep the pliers light and reduce printing time. The first layer height also had to be adjusted to 0.2mm because of the printer being used.
