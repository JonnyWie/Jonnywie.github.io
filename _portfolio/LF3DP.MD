# Purpose

The purpose of this project was to develop a syringe pump assembly that could automate the process of injecting fluids into a patient over a given period of time. This project was done through the use of off the shelf parts and custom made 3D printed parts. This drastically decreased the cost of making an adjutable syringe pump assembly. This project can be easily replicated for anybody else that is trying to improve this product or decrease cost as this project has done. 




# Features

* **Adjustable Flow Rate.** The flow rate of the fluid being pushed through the syringe pumps can also be easily changed so that this syringe pump may be used to administer a wide variety of drugs to patients. The flow rate can range from 0.012â€“300 mL/min.
* **Compatible with Multiple Syringe Sizes** This syringe pump can hold a 5mL syringe and a 20mL syringe. Both syringes can be run individually or at the same time. 
* **Minimal User Input** The syringe pump requires minimal user input in order to function. The user must load and unload the syringes before after after each use. The user must also start and stop the machine. The syringe pump will automatically stop once the syringe is empty. There is also a LED to warn the user when the pump is running, when the pump is stopped, and when the pump is out of fluid.
