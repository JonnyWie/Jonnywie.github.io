# Purpose

The purpose of this project was to develop a syringe pump assembly that could automate the process of injecting fluids into a patient over a given period of time. This project was done through the use of off the shelf parts and custom made 3D printed parts. This drastically decreased the cost of making an adjutable syringe pump assembly. This project can be easily replicated for anybody else that is trying to improve this product or decrease cost as this project has done. 

# Features

* **Adjustable Flow Rate.** The flow rate of the fluid being pushed through the syringe pumps can also be easily changed so that this syringe pump may be used to administer a wide variety of drugs to patients. The flow rate can range from 0.012â€“300 mL/min.
* **Compatible with Multiple Syringe Sizes** This syringe pump can hold a 5mL syringe and a 20mL syringe. Both syringes can be run individually or at the same time. 
* **Affordable Pellet Feedstock** Pellets are the cheapest form of feedstock for any plastic-based manufacturing process. Save 50-75% of material costs by using pellets instead of spools of filament. Concentrated colorant can be added to the virgin material to achieve any color in the rainbow without requiring large amounts of storage. Recyled material can also be used for sustainable material printing.
